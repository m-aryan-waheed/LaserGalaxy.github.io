# LaserGalaxy

LaserGalaxy is a retro-style arcade space shooter game where players pilot a spaceship through an endless star field. The objective is to survive as long as possible by dodging enemies, shooting them down, and collecting power-ups. The gameplay emphasizes fast reactions, accuracy, and strategic movement to avoid collisions and maximize scores.

# Features

LaserGalaxy includes a variety of engaging features to enhance the player experience. Players can access achievements, take on various challenges, and complete structured missions. The game also includes a tutorial to help new players learn the controls and mechanics, as well as a settings menu to customize gameplay. Enemies and asteroids can be destroyed to earn money, increase laser power, and activate a defensive shield. The player begins with 100 HP and loses 10 HP every time they are hit or crash into an object.

# Controls

The controls are simple and designed for quick gameplay. Players can use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship horizontally. The spacebar is used to shoot lasers at enemies and obstacles. These basic controls allow players to quickly get into the action without a steep learning curve.

# Platform

LaserGalaxy is currently available as a web-based game and is ready to play. It is developed using the Pygame library. At this stage, the game is only available for web browsers, but future updates may include additional platforms for a wider range of devices and users.

# Development Status
